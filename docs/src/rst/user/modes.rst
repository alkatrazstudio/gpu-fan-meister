* :doc:`modes/curve` - graph of fan speed versus temperature.
* :doc:`modes/fanToggle` - turning fans on and off using configurable set of rules.
* :doc:`modes/script` - controlling fan speed by an arbitrary algorithm.
* :doc:`modes/gpu` - video card controls the fans.

The functionality of ":doc:`modes/curve`" and ":doc:`modes/fanToggle`" modes can also be extended with scripts. See the description of :ref:`"Override" switch <mode-script-override>`.
