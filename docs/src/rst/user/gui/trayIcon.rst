Tray icon
=========

A separate tray icon will be displayed for each video card. The icon contains information about the temperature and fan speed:

    * **Temperature** in degrees Celsius is indicated by a number in the center of the icon. The color of the number corresponds to the rules specified in the ":doc:`devOptions`" window.

    * **Fan speed** is indicated by a frame around the number. The color of the frame corresponds to the rules specified in the ":doc:`devOptions`" window.

If you put the cursor over an icon, you can see a pop-up window with a more detailed information summary about the selected video card.

Right-clicking on the icon will show the context menu, which can be used to do the following:

* Open the :doc:`main window <mainWindow>` of |project|

* Open the :doc:`tray icon color settings <devOptions>`

* Open the full user manual in your browser. 

* Exit the application.

Left click on the icon will show the :doc:`main window <mainWindow>` of the application.
